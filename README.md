# 🌦️IoT Weather Monitoring System with Custom Web Dashboard
A fully functional IoT-based Weather Monitoring System built using ESP32, DHT11, and MQ-135, integrated with a custom web dashboard for real-time environmental monitoring.

This system continuously collects temperature, humidity, and air quality (AQI) data and displays it on a modern, responsive web interface hosted on Netlify, making it accessible from anywhere in the world.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project combines embedded systems, IoT networking, and web development to create a smart environmental monitoring solution.

The ESP32 reads sensor data and sends it over Wi-Fi to a web server. The web application (built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) fetches this data and visualizes it in real time, along with health-based air quality suggestions.

# 🔁 Working Flow
Sensors collect data (Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality)

ESP32 processes and sends data via Wi-Fi

Web app fetches data from ESP32

Data is displayed on the dashboard in real time

AQI is analyzed and smart suggestions are shown

# 📊 AQI Interpretation
AQI Range	Air Quality	Suggestion
0–50	Good	Safe for all activities
51–100	Moderate	Acceptable
